## Development Journey

This project was built incrementally to demonstrate not just how to build a chess game, but how to layer on functionality in stages. Below are snapshots showing the evolution of my project:

### 1️⃣ Initial Setup – Basic Chessboard
> Set up the base board layout using `chessboard.js`.
